# Inconsistent Rendering with Tailwind's Arbitrary Value Feature

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tailwind CSS's arbitrary value feature.  While generally useful, it can sometimes lead to inconsistent rendering.

## Bug Description

The core issue lies in the use of `px-10` (or similar arbitrary values). In certain situations or browsers, it may fail to render as expected, creating layout inconsistencies.  This is mainly due to the fact that Tailwind isn't designed to handle arbitrary pixel values reliably.

## Solution

The most reliable solution is to avoid using the arbitrary value syntax and instead use predefined Tailwind classes.  This ensures compatibility and predictable behavior across different environments.
